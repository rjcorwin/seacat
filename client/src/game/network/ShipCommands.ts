/**
 * Handles all ship control network commands and player-ship interactions.
 *
 * This class abstracts the MEW protocol messaging for ship interactions, providing
 * a clean API for sending control commands to ship servers. It also manages local
 * client state for which ship/control point the player is controlling.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Send grab/release control commands for wheel, sails, mast, and cannons
 * - Send steering and sail adjustment commands to ship servers
 * - Send cannon aiming, elevation, and firing commands
 * - Send projectile hit claims for damage detection
 * - Manage local control state (which ship, which control point, which cannon)
 * - Handle mast climbing with client-side camera zoom effects
 * - Validate control state before sending commands
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - MEWClient for sending messages to ship servers
 * - Ship state map for validating control points exist
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const shipCommands = new ShipCommands(
 *   scene,
 *   mewClient,
 *   playerId,
 *   ships,
 *   setControllingShip,
 *   setControllingPoint,
 *   setControllingCannon,
 *   setCurrentCannonAim
 * );
 *
 * // Grab ship wheel
 * shipCommands.grabControl(shipId, 'wheel');
 *
 * // Steer ship
 * shipCommands.steer(shipId, -0.5); // Turn left
 *
 * // Fire cannon
 * shipCommands.fireCannon(shipId, 'port', 0);
 *
 * // Release control
 * shipCommands.releaseControl(controllingShip, controllingPoint, controllingCannon);
 * ```
