# Steam Deck Deployment Targets
# Copy this file to steamdeck-hosts.txt and customize for your devices
#
# Usage:
#   cp steamdeck-hosts.txt.example steamdeck-hosts.txt
#   # Edit steamdeck-hosts.txt with your device hostnames or IPs
#   npm run deploy:steamdeck
#
# Format: One hostname or IP address per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored

# Example 1: Using mDNS hostnames (requires unique hostnames on each deck)
steamdeck1.local
steamdeck2.local
steamdeck3.local

# Example 2: Using IP addresses (more reliable on some networks)
# 192.168.1.101
# 192.168.1.102
# 192.168.1.103

# Example 3: Mix of both
# steamdeck1.local
# 192.168.1.102
# steamdeck3.local

# Setup Instructions:
#
# 1. Set unique hostname on each Steam Deck (for mDNS):
#    On Steam Deck in Desktop Mode:
#      sudo hostnamectl set-hostname steamdeck1  # or steamdeck2, steamdeck3, etc.
#      sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon
#
# 2. Enable SSH on each Steam Deck (required):
#    On Steam Deck in Desktop Mode:
#      sudo systemctl enable sshd
#      sudo systemctl start sshd
#
# 3. Set up SSH keys (optional, but recommended to avoid password prompts):
#    On your development machine:
#      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "seacat-deployment"
#      ssh-copy-id deck@steamdeck1.local  # repeat for each device
#
# 4. Find your Steam Deck's IP address (if using IPs instead of hostnames):
#    On Steam Deck in Desktop Mode, open Konsole:
#      ip addr show | grep "inet "
#    Look for your local network IP (usually 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)
