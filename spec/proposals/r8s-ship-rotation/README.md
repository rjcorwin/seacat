# Proposal r8s: Ship Rotation

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2025-10-18
**Complexity:** High

## Quick Summary

Add visual and physical rotation to ships in Seacat so they face the direction they're moving. This affects ship sprite rendering, collision detection, and player positioning on deck.

## Problem

Ships have 8-directional heading but don't rotate visually. A ship moving north looks the same as a ship moving east, and the collision boundaries don't match the visual orientation.

## Solution

Implement runtime sprite rotation, oriented bounding box collision, and rotate players on deck when the ship turns.

## Impact

- **Visual:** Ships will face their heading direction
- **Gameplay:** Deck boundaries will rotate, players will rotate with ship
- **Technical:** Adds rotation angle to ship state, OBB collision logic, player position rotation

## Files

- `proposal.md` - Detailed technical proposal with implementation phases
- `research.md` - Research on rotation algorithms, game implementations, and performance
- `decision-r8s-ship-rotation.md` - Formal decision document with risks and timeline

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase A:** Visual rotation (ship sprite rotates)
2. **Phase B:** Rotating collision (deck boundary rotates)
3. **Phase C:** Player rotation (players rotate with ship)
4. **Phase D:** Control point rotation (wheel/sails rotate)
5. **Phase E:** Ship-relative movement (optional/future)
6. **Phase F:** Smooth interpolation (polish)

## Estimated Effort

19-28 hours (2.5-3.5 days)

## Dependencies

- Milestone 5 (Ship controls) - ✅ Complete
- Milestone 6 (Platform coordinates) - ✅ Complete

## Next Steps

1. Review proposal
2. Approve/reject decision
3. Add to implementation plan
4. Begin Phase A implementation
