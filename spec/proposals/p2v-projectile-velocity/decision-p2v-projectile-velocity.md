# Decision: Projectile Velocity Coordinate System (p2v-projectile-velocity)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Option 2)
**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Implementation Date:** 2025-11-08
**Context:** c5x-ship-combat implementation revealed fundamental coordinate system mismatch

## Problem Statement

Cannon trajectories in seacat exhibit directionally-dependent behavior where:
- Firing **south** (bottom of diamond): Ball travels 3 tiles, hits water immediately
- Firing **north** (top of diamond): Ball travels 20+ tiles, flies excessively far
- Firing **east/west** (sides of diamond): Ball travels ~10 tiles (expected behavior)

### Root Cause

The server calculates projectile velocity as:
```typescript
vel.x = cos(fireAngle) * horizontalSpeed
vel.y = sin(fireAngle) * horizontalSpeed * SCALE - verticalComponent
```

The `sin(fireAngle)` term represents **horizontal ground movement** (north/south on the isometric map), but the client interprets `vel.y` as **pure vertical screen motion** (up/down like a side-scroller):

```typescript
// Client physics (ProjectileManager.ts:144-149)
proj.velocity.y += GRAVITY * deltaS  // Gravity affects Y
proj.sprite.x += proj.velocity.x * deltaS  // Move horizontally
proj.sprite.y += proj.velocity.y * deltaS  // Move vertically
```

**The fundamental issue:** In isometric projection, screen Y conflates two physically separate dimensions:
1. **Ground position** (north/south on the map)
2. **Height/elevation** (up/down in 3D space)

The current implementation mixes these in `vel.y`, causing the client's gravity to incorrectly affect horizontal ground movement.

## Option 1: Server-Only Fix (Simplified 2D Ballistics)

### Description
Remove isometric ground movement from velocity calculations entirely. Treat the game as a pure 2D side-scroller where:
- `vel.x` = horizontal screen direction (left/right)
- `vel.y` = vertical screen direction (up/down)
- Elevation controls only the initial upward velocity

### Implementation
```typescript
// Server (ShipServer.ts)
const vel: Velocity = {
  x: Math.cos(fireAngle) * horizontalSpeed,
  y: -verticalComponent,  // ONLY elevation, no sin(fireAngle)
};
```

### Pros
- ✅ **Minimal code changes** - server-only, no client refactor
- ✅ **Mathematically simple** - standard 2D projectile physics
- ✅ **Consistent trajectories** - all directions have same arc shape
- ✅ **Easy to tune** - single `verticalComponent` controls all arcs

### Cons
- ❌ **Incorrect for isometric** - ignores ground coordinate system
- ❌ **Non-uniform distances** - firing north/south still travels different screen distances than east/west due to tile geometry (32×16 px)
- ❌ **Visual disconnect** - cannonball appears to "slide" north/south without corresponding Y velocity
- ❌ **Breaks mental model** - players expect cannons to fire "across the map" not "across the screen"

### Example Behavior
- **Fire south**: `vel = (0, -150)` → moves straight up then falls
- **Fire north**: `vel = (0, -150)` → identical to south (wrong!)
- **Fire east**: `vel = (+260, -150)` → moves right with arc
- **Fire west**: `vel = (-260, -150)` → moves left with arc

**Result:** All shots arc upward the same amount, but north/south shots don't actually move across the map—they just move up and down on screen while staying in the same ground position.

## Option 2: Client Refactor (True 3D Isometric Physics)

### Description
Separate ground position from height in the physics simulation. Projectiles track:
1. **Ground position** (groundX, groundY) - horizontal movement on the map
2. **Height** (heightZ) - vertical elevation affected by gravity

Client converts to screen coordinates for rendering: `screenY = (groundX + groundY) / 2 - heightZ`

### Implementation

**Server (ShipServer.ts):**
```typescript
// Calculate 3D Cartesian velocity in ground-space
const cos_fire = Math.cos(fireAngle);
const sin_fire = Math.sin(fireAngle);

// Convert screen angle to ground azimuth
const cos_azimuth = (cos_fire + 2 * sin_fire) / norm;
const sin_azimuth = (2 * sin_fire - cos_fire) / norm;

// 3D velocity components
const groundVx = horizontalSpeed * cos_azimuth;
const groundVy = horizontalSpeed * sin_azimuth;
const heightVz = verticalComponent;

// Broadcast as 3D velocity
const vel = { groundVx, groundVy, heightVz };
```

**Client (ProjectileManager.ts):**
```typescript
// Update ground position (no gravity)
proj.groundX += proj.groundVx * deltaS;
proj.groundY += proj.groundVy * deltaS;

// Update height (with gravity)
proj.heightVz += GRAVITY * deltaS;  // Gravity only affects Z
proj.heightZ += proj.heightVz * deltaS;

// Convert to screen coordinates for rendering
proj.sprite.x = proj.groundX - proj.groundY;
proj.sprite.y = (proj.groundX + proj.groundY) / 2 - proj.heightZ;
```

### Pros
- ✅ **Mathematically correct** - proper 3D ballistics with isometric projection
- ✅ **Uniform distances** - all directions travel equal ground distance
- ✅ **Physically accurate** - gravity only affects height, not ground movement
- ✅ **Consistent trajectories** - same arc shape in all directions
- ✅ **Mental model alignment** - cannons fire across the map as expected
- ✅ **Extensible** - supports future features like terrain elevation, jumping, etc.

### Cons
- ❌ **Major refactor** - changes both server and client
- ❌ **Breaking change** - requires protocol update (`velocity` → `{groundVx, groundVy, heightVz}`)
- ❌ **Complexity** - more moving parts, harder to debug
- ❌ **Testing burden** - must verify all projectile interactions still work
- ❌ **Migration path** - how to handle old clients during rollout?

### Example Behavior
- **Fire south**: Ground moves south at 260 px/s, height arcs from +150 to water
- **Fire north**: Ground moves north at 260 px/s, height arcs from +150 to water
- **Fire east**: Ground moves east at 260 px/s, height arcs from +150 to water
- **Fire west**: Ground moves west at 260 px/s, height arcs from +150 to water

**Result:** All shots travel equal ground distance (~10-12 tiles) with identical arc shapes, correctly representing 3D ballistics in isometric space.

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Scaled Sin Component)

### Description
Keep the existing 2D screen-space physics but scale the `sin(fireAngle)` term to balance with elevation. This is a compromise between mathematical correctness and implementation simplicity.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Server (ShipServer.ts)
const ISO_Y_SCALE = 0.65;  // Empirically tuned
const vel: Velocity = {
  x: Math.cos(fireAngle) * horizontalSpeed,
  y: Math.sin(fireAngle) * horizontalSpeed * ISO_Y_SCALE - verticalComponent,
};
```

### Pros
- ✅ **Minimal changes** - server-only, one-line fix
- ✅ **No protocol changes** - works with existing client
- ✅ **Tunable** - can adjust `ISO_Y_SCALE` to balance distances
- ✅ **Includes direction** - cannons do fire across the map

### Cons
- ❌ **Not mathematically correct** - arbitrary scaling factor
- ❌ **Still conflates dimensions** - mixes ground movement with elevation
- ❌ **Difficult to tune** - no clear way to calculate ideal scale factor
- ❌ **Approximate solution** - distances won't be perfectly equal
- ❌ **Fragile** - breaks if tile dimensions, gravity, or elevation change
- ❌ **Unintuitive** - why 0.65? Magic number with no clear justification

### Example Behavior (with 0.65x scaling)
- **Fire south**: `vel.y = +169 - 150 = +19` → slight downward trend, arcs up then down
- **Fire north**: `vel.y = -169 - 150 = -319` → strong upward, flies very far
- **Fire east**: `vel.y = 0 - 150 = -150` → moderate upward arc
- **Fire west**: `vel.y = 0 - 150 = -150` → moderate upward arc

**Result:** Distances more balanced than no scaling, but still unequal. South travels ~5 tiles, north travels ~15 tiles, east/west travel ~10 tiles.

## Recommendation

**Choose Option 2 (Client Refactor - True 3D Isometric Physics)** despite higher implementation cost.

### Rationale

1. **Correctness over convenience** - This is a foundational system. Getting it right now prevents compounding technical debt.

2. **Already experiencing pain** - We've spent significant time debugging coordinate system issues. A proper fix eliminates an entire class of bugs.

3. **Future-proofing** - Proper 3D physics enables:
   - Terrain elevation (hills, cliffs)
   - Character jumping/climbing
   - Flying projectiles (arrows, spells)
   - Building heights
   - Multi-level maps

4. **Clear semantics** - Separating ground position from height makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Performance is fine** - The additional coordinate conversion is negligible (<1% CPU).

### Migration Path

1. **Phase 1:** Implement server-side 3D velocity calculation
2. **Phase 2:** Update protocol to support both 2D and 3D velocity formats
3. **Phase 3:** Update client to handle 3D physics, fall back to 2D for old messages
4. **Phase 4:** After 1 version, remove 2D fallback support

### If Option 2 is Rejected

Fall back to **Option 1 (Simplified)** with explicit documentation that this is a limitation. Do NOT use Option 3 (Scaled) as it's a band-aid that makes the problem harder to fix later.

## Decision

**✅ Option 2 Selected and Implemented** - True 3D Isometric Physics

### Rationale

We chose correctness over convenience. This is foundational game mechanics, and getting it right now prevents compounding technical debt and enables future features like terrain elevation, jumping, and multi-level maps.

### Implementation Completed

- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Update protocol types (Velocity → Velocity3D with groundVx, groundVy, heightVz)
- [x] Implement server changes (ShipServer.ts:689-719)
- [x] Implement client changes (ProjectileManager.ts:163-172)
- [x] Add server hit validation with physics replay (ShipServer.ts:784-870)
- [x] Add height threshold validation (prevents high-arc exploits)
- [x] Add unit tests for physics synchronization (ShipServer.test.ts)
- [x] Update CHANGELOG

### Additional Work: Server Hit Validation Sync

During implementation, we discovered the server's hit validation was using an analytical ballistic formula while the client used iterative Euler integration. This could cause valid hits to be rejected or invalid hits to be accepted.

**Fix applied:**
- Server now uses iterative physics replay matching client's 60 FPS simulation
- Added height threshold validation (`abs(heightZ) < 30px`) to prevent exploits
- Created comprehensive unit tests (11 tests) ensuring physics stay synchronized

See `implementation.md` for full details.
