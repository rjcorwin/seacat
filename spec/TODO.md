# To Do

## MVP for play test
- [x] cannon ball shadows
- [x] bug: cannon retical should be on top of sprite
- [x] left/right indicator for ship's helm
- [x] bug: when releasing from crow's next grab point, should return to zoom level at start (too zoomed in)
- [x] bug: our recent adjustment of the cannon pitch going up/down too fast now has it going way too slow
- [x] indicator of sails up/down when holding them
- [x] Make a build that I can install on my steamdeck
- [x] sprite: add helm
- [x] mast zoom out (crows nest) should increase the draw distance of the viewable world
- [ ] When selected a grab point, move character to a default point for that grab point. Plus adjustments for grab points.
- [ ] fade in of tiles on movement, the border that is fading in, i think it's 3 rows deep, let's switch to 2 with the inside tile very close to not transparent to clean things up, less blury at the edges when moving.
- [ ] Only fade water tiles, keep other tiles always in.
- [ ] sprite: cannons, and sail lines to ship sprite

## phase 2 - advanced ships
- [ ] inventory system for ship
- [ ] supply spawns in the world
- [ ] breaking waves near shoreline with shallow water tile that combines a slightly translucent water tile and sand tile just underneath
- [ ] Allow characters to surf wave into shore
- [ ] Ships collisions
- [ ] On sail down, show sails position change
- [ ] Character sprites (multiple with option to pick)
- [ ] Seperate the ship's mast/sail sprites  so when characters walk behind the mast/sail, they appear behind it.
- [ ] Add a parallax sky background

## phase 3 - player movement
- [ ] support player jump with mid-air dash
- [ ] player swords
