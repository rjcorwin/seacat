# To Do

- [ ] Show control points above the ship sprite
- [x] Fix the bug in cannon trajectories (when pointing south with cannon all the way up, immediately hits water on firing but should be up in the air for a while) - Fixed by removing ship Y-velocity inheritance from projectile calculations
- [ ] Cannon ball shadows

- [ ] controller support

- [ ] breaking waves near shoreline with shallow water tile that combines a slightly translucent water tile and sand tile just underneath
- [ ] Allow characters to surf wave into shore

- [ ] Ships collisions
- [ ] On sail down, show sails position change

- [ ] Control points on ship should be a different ship sprite to show the item highlighted. Having separate control point sprites will be too floaty.

- [ ] Character sprites (multiple with option to pick)
- [ ] Seperate the ship's mast/sail sprites  so when characters walk behind the mast/sail, they appear behind it.
- [ ] Show cannons on deck
- [ ] Add debug mode that only shows certain things like control points and health bars when enabled via a start screen checkbox

- [ ] Zoom perspective out 30%. ANything outside of original perspective we don't render. 
- [ ] Add a parallax sky background

- [ ] Make a build that I can install on my steamdeck

- [ ] Support player jump with mid-air dash

- [ ] Basic NPC that takes directions via MCP tool calls
- [ ] AI controlled NPC inspired by the text-based maze space that MEWAgent is able to path find given a goal

- [ ] Add a map mode
- [ ] Stormy weather
- [ ] Character swords
- [ ] Character block with strafe 
- [ ] Character lunge
- [ ] Double-barrel cannons
- [ ] Shader for dynamic water effects
- [ ] Reduce jitter of the player
